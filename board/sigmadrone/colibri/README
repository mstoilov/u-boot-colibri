Building U-boot for Colibri
-----------------------------

To build U-Boot for the Colibri Dual Lite version:

$ make colibri_dl_config
$ make

To build U-Boot for the Colibri Solo version:

$ make colibri_solo_config
$ make

To build U-Boot for the Colibri Quad version:

$ make colibri_quad_config
$ make

Flashing U-boot into the SD card
--------------------------------

- After the 'make' command completes, the generated 'u-boot.imx' binary must be
flashed into the SD card;

$ sudo dd if=u-boot.imx of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512 seek=2; sync

(Note - the SD card node may vary, so adjust this as needed).

- Insert the SD card into the slot located in the bottom of the board (same side
as the mx6 processor)

- Connect the serial cable to the host PC

- Power up the board and U-boot messages will appear in the serial console.
